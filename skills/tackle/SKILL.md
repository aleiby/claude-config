# Tackle - Upstream-Aware Implementation Workflow

## Quick Reference

```
/tackle <issue>         Start working on issue
/tackle --resume        Continue after compaction/restart (auto-detects step)
/tackle --resume <step> Load guidance for specific step (plan, implement, validate, etc.)
/tackle --status        Show current state
/tackle --abort         Abandon tackle, clean up
/tackle --refresh       Force refresh upstream research
/tackle --help          Show this help
```

When user asks for help, show this Quick Reference section.

## When Things Go Wrong

**STOP. Do not try to fix skill/workflow problems yourself.**

If you encounter:
- Script errors or unexpected failures
- Commands that don't work as documented
- Confusing or contradictory instructions
- State that doesn't match what's expected
- Workflow that seems stuck or broken

**Do this instead:**

1. **Stop immediately** - Don't retry, work around, or guess at fixes
2. **Mail the mayor** with:
   - What step you were on
   - What you tried to do
   - The exact error or unexpected behavior
   - Relevant state (`gt hook --json`, `bd --no-daemon mol current`)
3. **Wait for guidance** - The mayor will investigate and fix the skill

```bash
# Report problem to mayor
STEP="gate-submit"  # Current step
ERROR_DESC="ci-status-check.sh failed with unexpected error"
ERROR_MSG="jq: error: Cannot iterate over null"  # Optional
source "$SKILL_DIR/resources/scripts/report-problem.sh"
```

**Why this matters:** Attempting to fix workflow problems mid-tackle often makes things worse. Problems reported to the mayor get fixed in the skill itself, helping all future runs.

## Resumption Protocol (ALWAYS FIRST)

**When to run this:** After session restart (compaction, handoff, new terminal), or when checking status with `/tackle --status`. This ensures you have accurate state before taking any action.

**NEVER trust summary alone. State is truth.**

### SKILL_DIR (Required)

Before running any tackle scripts, set `SKILL_DIR` to the directory containing this SKILL.md file:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<path-to-tackle-skill-directory>"  # Set this based on where you loaded the skill
```

All subsequent `source` commands use `$SKILL_DIR`. Preserve this variable throughout the tackle session.

### Environment Check

Verify required environment variables are set (especially after compaction):

```bash
source "$SKILL_DIR/resources/scripts/env-check.sh"
```

**Checks**: `BD_ACTOR` (built-in), `SKILL_DIR` (set above)

**If BD_ACTOR is missing**: This may be a compaction bug. Report to mayor.

### Context Recovery

Recover all variables needed for tackle execution:

```bash
source "$SKILL_DIR/resources/scripts/context-recovery.sh"
```

This sets: `ISSUE_ID`, `MOL_ID`, `ORG_REPO`

**Errors**: Exits 1 if upstream not found in issue notes or git remotes.

### Claiming Current Step

If `bd mol current` shows a step but you're not the assignee:
```bash
source "$SKILL_DIR/resources/scripts/claim-step.sh"
```

This sets: `STEP_ID`

**Requires**: `MOL_ID` must be set.

### On Errors

**If any resumption step fails unexpectedly: See "When Things Go Wrong" above.** Don't debug - mail the mayor.

## Resource Loading (Progressive Disclosure)

**DO NOT load all resource files.** Load only what's needed for your current step.

Check current step with `bd --no-daemon mol current`, then use this lookup:

| If Current Step Is | Load Resource |
|--------------------|---------------|
| plan, branch, implement | IMPLEMENT.md |
| gate-plan, gate-submit | (none - see gate details in this file) |
| validate | VALIDATION.md |
| submit, record | SUBMIT.md |
| reflect | REFLECT.md |

**Pre-molecule research:** Handled by sub-agents (see Sub-Agent Usage below). Main agent only loads compact YAML results.

## Sub-Agent Usage (Context Optimization)

**Use sub-agents for research phases** to reduce context in the main conversation. Sub-agents load their own resource files, execute API calls, and return compact structured summaries.

### When to Use Sub-Agents

| Phase | Sub-Agent? | Reason |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Project Research (Step 4) | **Yes** | Only when cache stale; fetches lots of API data |
| Pending PR Check (Step 6) | **Yes** | Runs every tackle, loops through multiple issues |
| Issue Research (Step 7) | **Yes** | Runs every tackle, checks multiple repos |
| Implementation | No | Needs full codebase context |
| Gates | No | Requires user interaction |

**Important:** Cache freshness checks stay in SKILL.md to avoid spawning sub-agents unnecessarily.

## State Management via Beads Molecules

**Starting a tackle (uses gt sling):**
```bash
# Store upstream context in the issue bead (bead carries its own context)
bd update "$ISSUE_ID" --notes "upstream: $ORG_REPO"

# Sling the issue with tackle formula - this:
# 1. Creates a wisp from the tackle formula
# 2. Bonds the wisp to the issue bead
# 3. Hooks the issue to self (status=hooked)
# 4. Stores attached_molecule in the issue bead's description
gt sling tackle --on "$ISSUE_ID"
```

**Check current state:**
```bash
gt hook                      # What's on my hook? Shows work + attached molecule
bd --no-daemon mol current   # Show current step in the molecule
bd ready                     # Find next executable step
```

**Get molecule ID:**
```bash
MOL_ID=$(gt hook --json | jq -r '.attached_molecule')
```

**Advance through steps:**
```bash
bd close "$STEP_ID" --continue   # Complete step and auto-advance
```

## Phase Flow

```
Pre-molecule (research):
  - Detect Upstream
  - [Project Research → Project Report] (only if cache stale)
  - Issue Research (checks all tracked repos)
      → Existing Work Decision → (skip | wait | proceed)
  - Sling Issue with Tackle Formula

Molecule steps (implementation):
  Plan → GATE:Plan
    → Branch → Implement → Validate → GATE:Submit
      → Submit → Record → Reflect
```

## Execution Instructions

### Parse Command

First, parse what the user wants:

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `/tackle <issue>` | Start or resume tackle for issue |
| `/tackle --resume` | Continue in-progress tackle after compaction/restart (runs Resumption Protocol) |
| `/tackle --status` | Show current tackle state via `bd --no-daemon mol current` |
| `/tackle --abort` | Abandon tackle, clean up molecule and branch |
| `/tackle --refresh` | Force refresh upstream research |
| `/tackle --help` | Show Quick Reference to user |

### Starting Tackle

When starting `/tackle <issue>`:

#### 1. Check for Existing Work

```bash
gt hook
```

If work is hooked with an attached molecule, resume from current step:
```bash
bd --no-daemon mol current
bd ready
```

If no molecule attached, continue with fresh tackle setup below.

#### 2. Resolve Issue

The user's input may be an issue ID, partial match, or description.

```bash
# Try direct lookup (use || true to avoid exit on not found)
bd show <issue> || true
```

If not found, search for matches:
```bash
bd ready -n 0 --json | jq -r '.[] | "\(.id): \(.title)"'
```

If no matches, offer to create a bead for the work.

Once resolved, set the variable for subsequent steps:
```bash
ISSUE_ID="<resolved-issue-id>"  # e.g., "hq-1234"
```

#### 3. Detect Upstream

```bash
source "$SKILL_DIR/resources/scripts/detect-upstream.sh"
```

This sets: `UPSTREAM_REMOTE`, `UPSTREAM_URL`, `ORG_REPO`, `DEFAULT_BRANCH`, `UPSTREAM_REF`

**Errors**: Exits 1 if no valid remote found or URL cannot be parsed.

Variables set:
- `$UPSTREAM_REMOTE` - the git remote name (upstream, fork-source, or origin)
- `$UPSTREAM_URL` - the remote URL
- `$ORG_REPO` - the org/repo format (e.g., "steveyegge/beads")
- `$DEFAULT_BRANCH` - the default branch name (e.g., "main")
- `$UPSTREAM_REF` - the full ref (e.g., "upstream/main")

**Placeholder aliases used in this skill:**

Angle-bracket placeholders indicate values to substitute with actuals:
- `<upstream>` = `$ORG_REPO` (e.g., "steveyegge/beads")
- `<issue-id>` = the local bead ID being tackled
- `<molecule-id>` = the tackle molecule ID (gt-mol-xxx)
- `<skill-dir>` = directory where this skill was loaded from
- `<cache-bead-id>` = cache bead ID from Step 4
- `<pending-issues-json>` = JSON array from PENDING_JSON
- `<tracked-repos-json>` = JSON array from TRACKED_REPOS
- `<search-terms-array>` = keywords extracted from issue title
- `<upstream-issue-number>` = GitHub issue number (or null)
- `<upstream-pr-url>` = the draft PR URL on upstream repo

**Sub-agent prompts:** Replace all `<placeholders>` with actual values before spawning - sub-agents don't inherit shell variables.

**Persistence:** These variables don't persist across sessions. The upstream is stored in the issue bead's notes before slinging:
```bash
bd update "$ISSUE_ID" --notes "upstream: $ORG_REPO"
gt sling tackle --on "$ISSUE_ID"
```
When resuming, get the issue bead ID from hook and read its notes:
```bash
ISSUE_ID=$(gt hook --json | jq -r '.bead_id')
ORG_REPO=$(bd show "$ISSUE_ID" --json | jq -r '.[0].notes' | grep -oP 'upstream: \K[^\s]+')
```

#### 4. Project Research (cache check + sub-agent if stale)

Check if project-level research cache needs refreshing.

**Cache freshness check (stays in main agent):**
```bash
source "$SKILL_DIR/resources/scripts/cache-freshness.sh"
```

This sets: `CACHE_BEAD`, `CACHE_FRESH`

**Requires**: `ORG_REPO` must be set.

**If cache is fresh:** Skip to Step 6 (Pending PR Check).

**If cache is stale or missing:** Invoke sub-agent:
```
Use Task tool with:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: |
    Read resource file: <skill-dir>/resources/subagents/PROJECT-RESEARCH.md

    Execute with inputs:
    ```yaml
    inputs:
      org_repo: "<upstream>"
      cache_bead: "<cache-bead-id>"  # or "null" if not found
    ```

    Return structured YAML as specified in the resource file.
```

#### 5. Project Report (only if new data found)

If project research sub-agent ran, present checkpoint with the returned data:
- Guidelines summary
- Related repos detected (offer to track)

User can add more related repos or continue to Step 6.

#### 6. Check Pending PR Outcomes (Sub-Agent)

**Before proceeding with any new work, clean up stale PR submissions.**

This is a housekeeping gate - check ALL issues with `pr-submitted` label.

**Gather inputs for sub-agent:**
```bash
# Build pending issues list
# Notes contain "PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123" format
# Extract PR number from the URL path
PENDING_JSON=$(bd list --label=pr-submitted --json 2>/dev/null | jq '[.[] | {
  id: .id,
  pr_number: ((.notes // "") | capture("pull/(?<n>[0-9]+)")? | .n // null),
  title: .title
}] | map(select(.pr_number))')

echo "$PENDING_JSON"
```

**Invoke sub-agent:**
```
Use Task tool with:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: |
    Read resource file: <skill-dir>/resources/subagents/PR-CHECK.md

    Execute with inputs:
    ```yaml
    inputs:
      org_repo: "<upstream>"
      pending_issues: <pending-issues-json>
    ```

    Return structured YAML as specified in the resource file.
```

**Handle result:**
The sub-agent returns a `pr_check` YAML with `summary` and `actions_taken`.

Report to user:
```
Checked N pending PR(s): <actions_taken summary>
```

If no pending PRs, sub-agent returns `checked_count: 0` - report explicitly.

#### 7. Issue Research (Sub-Agent)

**Check if the current issue is already addressed.**

**Gather inputs for sub-agent:**
```bash
# Get tracked repos from cache (requires yq: https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)
TRACKED_REPOS=$(yq -o=json '.tackle.tracked_repos // []' .beads/config.yaml 2>/dev/null)
# Falls back to just ORG_REPO if no cache
[ "$TRACKED_REPOS" = "[]" ] || [ -z "$TRACKED_REPOS" ] && TRACKED_REPOS="[\"$ORG_REPO\"]"

# Extract upstream issue number from external_ref field
# Format convention: "gh:<org>/<repo>#<number>" or "issue:<number>" for simple cases
# Examples: "gh:steveyegge/beads#123", "issue:456"
# Set via: bd create --external-ref "gh:org/repo#123" or bd update --external-ref "..."
UPSTREAM_ISSUE=$(bd show "$ISSUE_ID" --json | jq -r '.[0].external_ref // empty' | grep -oE '#[0-9]+$|issue:[0-9]+' | grep -oE '[0-9]+')

# Extract search terms from issue title
ISSUE_TITLE=$(bd show "$ISSUE_ID" --json | jq -r '.[0].title')
```

**Invoke sub-agent:**
```
Use Task tool with:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: |
    Read resource file: <skill-dir>/resources/subagents/ISSUE-RESEARCH.md

    Execute with inputs:
    ```yaml
    inputs:
      org_repo: "<upstream>"
      tracked_repos: <tracked-repos-json>
      issue_id: "<issue-id>"
      upstream_issue: <upstream-issue-number>  # or null if not set
      search_terms: <search-terms-array>
    ```

    Return structured YAML as specified in the resource file.
```

**Handle result:**
The sub-agent returns an `issue_research` YAML with `decision` and `reason`.

Use the `decision` field to determine next action:
- `proceed` → Continue to Step 8 (create molecule)
- `skip` → Present skip option to user
- `wait` → Present wait option with `blocking_work` details
- `fix_existing` → Present fix option with user's open PR details

#### 8. Existing Work Decision

If existing work found, present options:

```
Found existing work for this issue:
  - Upstream issue #123 is CLOSED
  - PR #456 already addresses this
  - You have PR #789 open (CI failing)

Options:
  - Skip tackle (close local issue)
  - Wait for existing PR to merge
  - Fix your existing PR
  - Proceed anyway
```

Accept natural language responses. If user chooses to skip/wait, do not create molecule.

#### 9. Sync Formula

Before creating the molecule, install the formula to town-level (user formulas, not project-specific):

```bash
# <skill-dir> is the directory containing SKILL.md (where you loaded this skill from)
FORMULA_SRC="<skill-dir>/resources/tackle.formula.toml"

# Install to town-level formulas (Tier 2 - cross-project, user workflows)
# GT_TOWN_ROOT is set by Gas Town, defaults to ~/gt
TOWN_FORMULAS="${GT_TOWN_ROOT:-$HOME/gt}/.beads/formulas"
mkdir -p "$TOWN_FORMULAS"
cp "$FORMULA_SRC" "$TOWN_FORMULAS/tackle.formula.toml"
```

#### 10. Sling Issue with Tackle Formula (only if proceeding)

**⚠️ PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST - Do not proceed until all items are checked:**

Before slinging the issue, verify you completed these steps:

- [ ] **Step 6 (Pending PR Check)** - Successfully ran PR-CHECK sub-agent to clean up stale submissions
- [ ] **Step 7 (Issue Research)** - Successfully ran ISSUE-RESEARCH sub-agent to check for existing work
- [ ] **Step 8 (Existing Work Decision)** - If existing work found, user confirmed to proceed

If you skipped any of these, **STOP and go back to the associated step(s)**. Duplicating work wastes maintainer time and may get your PR rejected. The sub-agents exist to offload this research from your context - use them.

```bash
# Store upstream context in the issue bead (bead carries its own context)
# This is needed because gt sling --on doesn't support --var
bd update "$ISSUE_ID" --notes "upstream: $ORG_REPO"

# Sling the issue with tackle formula
# This creates the molecule wisp, bonds it to the issue, hooks issue to self,
# and stores attached_molecule in the issue bead's description
gt sling tackle --on "$ISSUE_ID"

# Verify hook is set
if ! gt hook --json 2>/dev/null | jq -e '.attached_molecule' > /dev/null; then
  echo "ERROR: Sling failed - no molecule attached"
  echo "Check gt sling output above for errors"
  echo ">>> Mail the mayor (see 'When Things Go Wrong' above) - do NOT try to fix this yourself <<<"
  exit 1
fi

# Get molecule ID and first step from hook (avoids bd routing issues)
HOOK_JSON=$(gt hook --json)
MOL_ID=$(echo "$HOOK_JSON" | jq -r '.attached_molecule')
echo "Tackle started: $MOL_ID"

# Add formula label for pattern detection in reflect phase
bd update "$MOL_ID" --add-label "formula:tackle"

# CRITICAL: Claim first step with assignee so bd mol current works
# Use gt hook data directly (more reliable than bd ready --parent)
FIRST_STEP=$(echo "$HOOK_JSON" | jq -r '.progress.ready_steps[0] // empty')
if [ -n "$FIRST_STEP" ]; then
  if [ -z "${BD_ACTOR:-}" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: BD_ACTOR not set. Run env-check.sh first, or report to mayor."
    exit 1
  fi
  bd update "$FIRST_STEP" --status=in_progress --assignee "$BD_ACTOR"
fi
```

### Phase Execution

Based on current step (from `bd --no-daemon mol current`), take the appropriate action.
See Resource Loading table above for which resource file to load.

| Step ID | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `plan` | Create implementation plan |
| `gate-plan` | **STOP** - Wait for plan approval |
| `branch` | Create clean branch from upstream |
| `implement` | Write code following upstream conventions |
| `validate` | Run tests, check isolation |
| `gate-submit` | **STOP** - Wait for submit approval |
| `submit` | Mark draft PR ready for review |
| `record` | Update local issue with PR link |
| `reflect` | Reflect on skill issues (see Reflect section) |

### Completing Steps

After completing work for a step:
```bash
source "$SKILL_DIR/resources/scripts/complete-step.sh"
```

This sets: `NEXT_STEP`

**Requires**: `STEP_ID` and `MOL_ID` must be set.

This marks the step complete and advances to the next step. The assignee update is required because `bd mol current` filters by assignee - without it, the molecule becomes invisible.

**Note:** The fallback to `bd list --parent` works around a known issue where `bd ready --parent` may return empty even when steps are available.

**Continue until reflect is complete and root molecule is closed.** Tackle is not done until then.

---

## Project Research Notes

Project research logic is in **Step 4** of Starting Tackle:
- Cache freshness check runs in main agent (avoids unnecessary sub-agent spawn)
- If stale: PROJECT-RESEARCH sub-agent fetches data and updates cache bead
- 24-hour cache threshold

**Force Refresh:** `/tackle --refresh` bypasses the cache check and always spawns the sub-agent.

---

## APPROVAL GATES

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULES - READ THIS SECTION COMPLETELY**

### Response Detection

Accept natural language **approval**:
- "approve", "approved", "proceed", "continue"
- "yes", "lgtm", "looks good", "go ahead"
- "submit", "ship it" (at gate-submit only)

Accept natural language **explain** (gate-plan only):
- "explain", "why", "rationale", "reasoning"
- "tell me more", "justify", "alternatives"

Accept natural language **decline**:
- "decline", "reject", "no", "stop"
- "wait", "revise", "hold", "change"

### Gate Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

1. **NEVER** proceed past a gate without explicit user approval
2. **NEVER** auto-approve based on heuristics or timeouts
3. **NEVER** submit a PR without gate-submit approval
4. **ALL agents** stop at gates - no exceptions
5. If no human in loop, **WAIT INDEFINITELY** at the gate

---

## Gate 1: `gate-plan` (Plan Review)

**MANDATORY STOP** - Present the plan, then wait for explicit user approval before proceeding.

### Pre-Gate Preparation (Internal)

Before presenting the checkpoint, prepare internally (but don't show unless asked):

1. **Why this approach over alternatives** - What other solutions were considered? Why were they rejected?
2. **Key tradeoffs** - What are we accepting? Why is it acceptable?
3. **Root cause confidence** - How does this address the actual problem, not just symptoms?

Only present this if the user asks to "explain".

Options:
  1. Approve (continue to implementation)
  2. Explain (show rationale for this approach)
  3. Decline (request changes)
```

### On Approve

```bash
# STEP_ID from bd --no-daemon mol current
bd close "$STEP_ID" --continue
```

**If claiming** (plan indicated "Will claim"):
```bash
# Extract upstream issue number from the local issue's external_ref
# See Step 7 for format convention (gh:org/repo#123 or issue:123)
UPSTREAM_ISSUE=$(bd show "$ISSUE_ID" --json | jq -r '.[0].external_ref // empty' | grep -oE '#[0-9]+$|issue:[0-9]+' | grep -oE '[0-9]+')
if [ -n "$UPSTREAM_ISSUE" ]; then
  gh issue comment "$UPSTREAM_ISSUE" --repo "$ORG_REPO" --body "I'd like to work on this. I'll submit a PR soon."
fi
```

Proceed to branch creation.

### On Explain

Present the rationale you prepared internally:

```
## Rationale

**Why this approach:**
<explanation of the chosen solution>

**Alternatives considered:**
<what was rejected and why>

**Tradeoffs:**
<what we're accepting and why it's acceptable>

---
Options:
  1. Approve (continue to implementation)
  2. Decline (request changes)
```

After presenting rationale, wait for approve or decline.

### On Decline

```
What would you like to change about the plan?
```

Stay in plan phase, revise based on feedback. After making changes:
1. Update the plan in the `plan` step bead
2. Re-present the gate-plan checkpoint with updated content
3. Wait for approval again

Do NOT close the gate step until explicitly approved.

---

## Gate 2: `gate-submit` (Pre-Submit Review)

**MANDATORY STOP** - Create draft PR, present for review, wait for explicit user approval before marking ready.

### Variable Recovery (Required After Session Resume)

If resuming at this gate after compaction or new session, recover required variables:

```bash
# Recover ISSUE_ID, MOL_ID, ORG_REPO
source "$SKILL_DIR/resources/scripts/context-recovery.sh"

# Recover DEFAULT_BRANCH (needed for CI check)
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(gh api repos/$ORG_REPO --jq '.default_branch')
```

### Idempotent Entry (Critical for Session Recovery)

When entering gate-submit, FIRST check if a draft PR already exists:

```bash
source "$SKILL_DIR/resources/scripts/pr-check-idempotent.sh"

# If no PR exists, create draft
if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  git push -u origin $BRANCH
  gh pr create --repo $ORG_REPO --draft \
    --head "$FORK_OWNER:$BRANCH" \
    --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
  PR_URL=$(gh pr view --repo $ORG_REPO --json url --jq '.url')
  PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --repo $ORG_REPO --json number --jq '.number')
  IS_DRAFT=true
fi
```

This sets: `PR_NUMBER`, `IS_DRAFT`, `PR_URL`, `BRANCH`, `FORK_OWNER`

**Requires**: `ORG_REPO` must be set.

GitHub is the source of truth for PR state.

### Show to User

## Validation
  - Tests: PASSED
  - Isolation: PASSED (single concern)
  - Rebased: Yes, on upstream default branch

Approve to mark PR ready for maintainer review.
```

### On Approve

**First, check CI status** before marking PR ready:

```bash
source "$SKILL_DIR/resources/scripts/ci-status-check.sh"
```

This sets: `FAILED`, `PRE_EXISTING`, `PENDING`

**Requires**: `PR_NUMBER`, `ORG_REPO`, and `DEFAULT_BRANCH` must be set.

The script polls CI every 30 seconds while checks are pending, then checks if any failures are pre-existing on the default branch.

Present CI status to user:
```
CI Status:
  - Passed: <n>
  - Failed: <n> <if pre-existing: "(pre-existing on main)">
  - Skipped: <n>

<if failures are NOT pre-existing>
Options:
  - Fix failures and re-push (returns to implement phase)
  - Submit anyway (maintainer may reject)

<if all failures are pre-existing>
All failures are pre-existing on main. Safe to proceed.
```

**If user chooses "Fix failures":**

Do NOT close gate-submit. Stay at this gate and iterate:

1. Fix the failing check (e.g., run `golangci-lint run ./...` locally, fix issues)
2. Commit the fix: `git commit --amend` (keep single commit) or new commit
3. Force-push: `git push -f origin <branch>`
4. Wait for CI to re-run (poll with `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo $ORG_REPO --json statusCheckRollup`)
5. Re-present the gate-submit checkpoint with updated CI status
6. Repeat until CI passes or user chooses to submit anyway

**If CI passed** (or failures are pre-existing, or user chooses to submit anyway), store PR info and proceed:

```bash
GATE_BEAD=$(bd --no-daemon mol current --json | jq -r '.current_step.id')

bd update "$GATE_BEAD" --notes="pr_number: $PR_NUMBER
pr_url: $PR_URL
ci_status: passed
approved_at: $(date -Iseconds)"

bd close "$GATE_BEAD" --reason "Approved - PR #$PR_NUMBER ready for review" --continue
```

Proceed to submit phase (marks the draft PR as ready for review).

### On Reject

```
What would you like to change before submission?
Options:
  - Modify implementation (will force-push to update draft PR)
  - Update PR title/body (can edit draft PR directly)
  - Add more tests
  - Close draft PR and start over
  - Other changes
```

Return to implement phase for revisions. After making changes:
1. Force-push updated branch: `git push -f origin <branch>`
2. Update draft PR if needed: `gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --repo $ORG_REPO ...`
3. Re-run validation (tests, linter, isolation)
4. Re-present the gate-submit checkpoint
5. Wait for approval again

Do NOT close the gate step until explicitly approved.

## Gate Help

If user asks for help or seems confused at a gate:

```
You're at the <gate-name> gate.

This is a mandatory approval checkpoint. The skill will not proceed
until you explicitly approve or decline.

Respond naturally:
  "yes", "approve", "looks good" -> approve
  "why", "explain", "rationale" -> explain (gate-plan only)
  "no", "wait", "revise"        -> decline
```

## Agent Safety

**Critical for autonomous agents:**

Gates apply to ALL agents equally. No agent can bypass gates. No role-specific exceptions.

If an agent reaches a gate without a human in the loop:
1. Present gate
2. Wait for human approval
3. Do not timeout and auto-approve
4. Do not proceed on any heuristic

## Reflect

**⚠️ You are NOT done until this step is complete.** PR submission is not the end of the workflow.

The `reflect` step captures issues with the tackle process itself (not task-specific problems).

**Load REFLECT.md for full instructions.** At minimum, answer these before closing:

1. **Skill issues?** Wrong commands, unclear instructions, missing steps?
2. **Research issues?** Missed existing work, stale data, duplicated effort?
3. **Agent issues?** Needed user correction? Forgot steps? Wrong assumptions?

If any issues found: load REFLECT.md for recording format and pattern detection.

After completing the reflect assessment:

```bash
# 1. Close the reflect step (STEP_ID from bd --no-daemon mol current)
bd close "$STEP_ID" --reason "Clean run - no issues"  # or summary of findings

# 2. CRITICAL: Close the ROOT MOLECULE (not just the steps!)
# MOL_ID should already be set from context-recovery.sh, but verify it exists
if [ -z "$MOL_ID" ]; then
  MOL_ID=$(gt hook --json | jq -r '.attached_molecule // empty')
fi
if [ -z "$MOL_ID" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: No molecule ID found. Check gt hook or context-recovery.sh output."
else
  bd close "$MOL_ID" --reason "Tackle complete - PR submitted"
fi

# 3. Verify cleanup
bd --no-daemon mol current   # Should show "No molecules in progress"
gt hook                      # Should show "Nothing on hook"
```

**OUTPUT THIS BANNER when tackle completes:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✅ TACKLE COMPLETE: <issue-id> → PR #<number>          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Resuming (`/tackle --resume [step]`)

Use after compaction, handoff, or session restart to continue an in-progress tackle.

**What it does:**
1. Run the **Resumption Protocol** (see top of this file)
2. Load resource for the specified step (or auto-detect from `bd mol current`)
3. Continue execution

See **Resource Loading** section below for step names and their resources.

**When to use:**
- After `/compact`
- After `gt handoff` brings you back
- When starting a new session with work on hook
- When confused about tackle state
- When the formula step says "Run `/tackle --resume <step>`"

### Aborting (`/tackle --abort`)

To abandon a tackle mid-workflow:

1. **Burn the molecule** (discard without squashing):
   ```bash
   bd --no-daemon mol burn <molecule-id> --force
   ```

2. **Clean up branch** (if created):
   ```bash
   git checkout main  # or default branch
   git branch -D <tackle-branch>
   ```

3. **Update issue** (optional):
   ```bash
   bd update "$ISSUE_ID" --status=open --notes="Tackle aborted"
   ```

The issue returns to ready state for future work.

**OUTPUT THIS BANNER when tackle is aborted:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⛔ TACKLE ABORTED: <issue-id>                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Resource Loading

Resources are in the `resources/` folder relative to this SKILL.md file.

**Step to resource mapping:**

| Step | Resource |
|------|----------|
| plan | IMPLEMENT.md (Plan Phase section) |
| gate-plan | This file (gate-plan section below) |
| branch | IMPLEMENT.md (Branch Phase section) |
| implement | IMPLEMENT.md (Implement Phase section) |
| validate | VALIDATION.md |
| gate-submit | This file (gate-submit section below) |
| submit | SUBMIT.md |
| record | SUBMIT.md (Record Phase section) |
| reflect | REFLECT.md |

**Sub-agent resources (sub-agents load their own):**
- `<skill-dir>/resources/subagents/PROJECT-RESEARCH.md`
- `<skill-dir>/resources/subagents/ISSUE-RESEARCH.md`
- `<skill-dir>/resources/subagents/PR-CHECK.md`

Only load the resource needed for the current step to minimize context.

## Session Handoff

When handing off mid-tackle, include this context for the next session:

### Handoff Message Should Include

```markdown
## Tackle Status: <issue-id>

Molecule: <molecule-id>
Current step: <step-name> (from bd --no-daemon mol current)
Branch: <branch-name>

### Completed
- [x] plan (approved)
- [ ] implement (in progress)

### Key State
- Draft PR: #<number> (if created)
- PR URL: <url>
- Gate approvals: plan ok, submit pending

### Next Action
<what the next session should do>
```

### Resuming After Handoff

Run `/tackle --resume` - it handles molecule re-attachment and state recovery.
