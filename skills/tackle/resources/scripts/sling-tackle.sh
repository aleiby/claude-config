# sling-tackle.sh - Sling tackle formula onto issue and set up molecule
#
# Usage: source sling-tackle.sh
#
# Inputs (required):
#   ISSUE_ID  - The issue bead ID to tackle
#   ORG_REPO  - The upstream org/repo (e.g., "steveyegge/beads")
#
# Outputs (exported variables):
#   MOL_ID     - The created molecule ID
#   FIRST_STEP - The first ready step ID (may be empty)
#
# Side effects:
#   - Updates issue with upstream context
#   - Slings tackle formula (creates molecule, hooks issue)
#   - Claims first step with current actor
#
# Known issues (bd-69d7, bd-v29h):
#   Steps are linked via BLOCKING deps instead of parent-child.
#   bd update --parent doesn't work on wisps, so we can't fix this.
#   Use gt hook --json or bd dep list --type=blocks to find steps.
#
# Errors: Exits 1 with guidance if sling fails or BD_ACTOR not set
