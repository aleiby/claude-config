# query-friction.sh - Query closed tackle molecules for friction patterns
#
# Usage: source query-friction.sh
#        or: bash query-friction.sh
#
# Inputs: None
#
# Outputs:
#   Prints JSON of closed tackle molecules that had friction, showing:
#   - id: molecule ID
#   - close_reason: why it was closed
#   - notes: friction details (recorded in molecule notes before squashing)
#
# Use this to detect recurring issues before proposing skill fixes.
# Rule: 2+ occurrences = propose fix, 3+ = definitely fix
